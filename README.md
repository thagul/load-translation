# Load-translation


Demo app to test fetching ember-i18n translations live. Translation file is located into /public/i18n/. 
Translations are loaded from `translations-fetcher` service (see `beforeModel` in index route).

ember-cli-mirage is disabled in development environment, so json of translations file is rendered directly.

The problem currently is in tests. I would serve real json file, but I need to use mirage mock to make tests faster.
See `acceptance/index-test` which fails if I comment the mock in `mirage/config`.
